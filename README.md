## Running

To quickly start the application, run the docker-compose file, it would setup mongodb, redis and the rbs application.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

To start the process manually, ensure that you have a live mongodb server, redis server, then run

```bash
yarn install / npm install
yarn start:dev / npm run start:dev
```
